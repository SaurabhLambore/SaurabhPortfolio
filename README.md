Description-
This README document provides an overview of the "Portfolio" website project. The HTML code provided represents a simple portfolio website that showcases the work experience and skills of a developer named Saurabh. The website includes a navigation bar, sections for introduction and work experience, and a footer with social media links.

Project Structure-
The project consists of a single HTML file (index.html) that contains the entire code for the website. The website is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The index.html file includes the following main sections:

Header: Contains the website's navigation bar.

Main: Contains two sections:

First Section: Displays a welcome message and introduces Saurabh as a developer.
Second Section: Displays Saurabh's work experience with different technologies.
Footer: Contains the website's footer with contact information and social media links.

How to Use
To view the "Portfolio" website, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The website will display the content and animations as intended.

Styling
The website's styling is done using an external CSS file (portfolio.css), which is linked in the <head> section of the index.html file. The CSS file defines the layout, colors, and appearance of various elements on the website.

JavaScript
The website utilizes the Typed.js library (version 2.0.16) to create typing animations for certain sections. Typed.js allows text to be animated as if it is being typed out in real-time. The JavaScript code for the Typed.js animations is embedded directly in the index.html file within <script> tags.

External Resources
The website uses the following external resources:

Google Fonts: The Poppins font is imported from Google Fonts and used for the website's text.
Typed.js: The Typed.js library is loaded from the external source (unpkg.com) to enable the typing animations.
Compatibility
The code has been designed to work on modern web browsers with support for HTML5, CSS3, and ES6 JavaScript. It is recommended to use the latest version of popular web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge to ensure the best user experience.
